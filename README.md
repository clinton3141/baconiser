# the baconiser

A totally over engineered tool to find the shortest connection between items in
your own network of things. 

# Why?

To gain experience in architecture of large scale applications. In particular to
practice:
* building a scalable solutions using technologies which I haven't yet had the
need to use
* using interesting structures to manipulate and search data
* reasoning about algorithm efficiency big-O style
* so that I can build something fun

# Stack

In no particular order (that'll come later after initial setting up excitement 
has ceased), here's the current stack. 
* PHP 5.5.9
* nginx 1.9.7
* MySQL 5.5.46
